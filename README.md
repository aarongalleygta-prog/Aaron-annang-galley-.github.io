ABSTRACT
This project developed "AgriLearn Network," a five-page website for Ghanaian farmers. The website provides information on crop management, market prices, government schemes, weather alerts, and a community forum. The site was built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript without WYSIWYG tools. It is hosted on GitHub Pages at https://aarongalleygta-prog.github.io/Aaron-Galley-.github.io/. This report documents the development process.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION

1.1 Background
Agriculture is important to Ghana's economy. It employs over 45% of the workforce (MoFA, 2025). Most farmers are smallholders who grow maize, cassava, and vegetables. These farmers face challenges getting information about modern farming methods, market prices, and government programs.
Information technology can help solve these problems. Websites can deliver agricultural information to farmers through computers and phones. This project created a website called "AgriLearn Network" to help Ghanaian farmers access useful information.

1.2 Problem Statement
Ghanaian farmers face these problems:
•	Limited access to modern farming techniques - Many farmers use traditional methods and don't know about improved varieties or better practices
•	Lack of market information - Farmers often sell at low prices because they don't know current market rates
•	Poor weather information - Farmers need weather forecasts to plan planting and harvesting
•	Limited awareness of government programs - Many farmers don't know about schemes like Planting for Food and Jobs
•	Weak extension services - One extension officer serves over 1,500 farmers, making personal visits difficult
•	Farmer isolation - Farmers cannot easily share knowledge with each other

1.3 Objectives
The project aimed to:
1.	Create a five-page website with Home, Crop Management, Market Prices, Farmer Resources, and Contact pages
2.	Provide accurate information on maize, cassava, and vegetable farming
3.	Show current market prices for major commodities in Ghanaian markets
4.	List government schemes and provide weather alerts
5.	Add interactive features like a contact form and community forum
6.	Use images and videos appropriately
7.	Host the website on GitHub Pages
8.	Write a complete project report


1.4 Significance
This project helps:
•	Farmers - Get useful information to improve their farming and profits
•	Extension officers - Share information with more farmers
•	Students - Learn how to build agricultural websites
•	The Faculty - Show the quality of student work
